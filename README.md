# About

The project we developed here was an application designed for the Config Conference, an anually Figma Conferece. They have a website(https://config.figma.com/) but what they don't have is a mobile app which is what we've implemented in this project. You can download the code and run it in Xcode if you want to use the application.

In this project we discovered and explored a lot of differente SwiftUI features, here are some of them:
- DatePicker
- TabBar/TabView
- External fonts
- Sheets
- Buttons
- NavigationView/NavigationLink

Here is a little demo of our app and it also shows the dark mode version that we also developed:

Obs.: The data in the project was hard-coded and does not pull data from any outside source.
