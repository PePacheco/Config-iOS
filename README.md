# About

The project we developed here was an Applications Designed for the Config Conference, an anually Figma Conferece. They have a website(https://config.figma.com/) but what they don't have is a mobile app which is what we've implemented in this project. You can download the code and run it in Xcode if you want to use the application.
Obs.: The data in the project was hard-coded and does not pull data from any outside source.
